Prompt: 
You are given a specific coding or engineering task. Your job is to analyze the entire codebase, study all relevant files, and devise a clear, step-by-step plan for implementing the requested change. 

Your output should include:
- A high-level summary of your approach and reasoning.
- The specific files and locations (functions, classes, or line numbers) where you would add or modify code, with a brief explanation for each.
- The rationale behind each planned change, including any dependencies or design considerations.
- Any potential challenges or ambiguities you foresee, and how you would address them.

Do NOT write or edit any code at this stage. Only provide your plan and reasoning. 
Write the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_TITLE.md file in the current folder .claude/plans. 
ALways use the virtual environment present inside the root directory ie ".venv" and use it for all steps.
